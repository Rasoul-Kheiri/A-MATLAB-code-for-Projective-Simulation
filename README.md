# A-MATLAB-code-for-Projective-Simulation
Projective Simulation is a model for artificial intelligence introduced in 2012 by Hans J. Briegel &amp; Gemma De las Cuevas. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/srep00400

A MATLAB code for the Projective Simulation model is presented in the following section. The code can be used as a base model to understand the original article in 2012, or to write another code and obtain other developments, like my paper:
